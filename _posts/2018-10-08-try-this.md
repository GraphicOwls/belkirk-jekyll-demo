# Try This..

Keep going till you can't!

#### Getting Started

More sentences for the post. Just make a few more till you cover another line or so and then we can move on and add a photo or something cool like that! Still trying to wrap my head around this.

###### Small and clean list.

* One
* Two
* Three

###### Let's add a numbered list.

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

> Yay. Now we have some things going on.

Let's try a simple text [link](# "link").

![](/uploads/2018/02/17/building3.jpg)

    .code {
    	color: $primary
    }
